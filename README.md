# Shared Workflows

This repository contains a collection of caller workflows that are shared across our terraform module repositories. These workflows are platform agnostic and are designed to help streamline a variety of processes including the validation of terraform module deployments, linting checks, and the creation of github releases.

These workflows serve as the backbone for maintaining code quality, ensuring consistent deployment practices, and facilitating efficient release management within our projects.
